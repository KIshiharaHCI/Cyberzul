Greetings fellow byte traveler!,

Congratulations! You have arrived at the right place at the right time! We are in the early days of cyber civilization. The legendary Queen MaXIne has just visited our beloved Zulias for the very first time.

Awestruck by the interior beauty of the rectangular slab of baked bits and bytes (for simplicity we will refer to them as „tiles“) used in our home city, she decided to make it the center of her queendom. A seemingly endless tiling phase has just begun! Help her establish her empire and lead our civilization into a golden age.

Wait for other Zulians to join the game and as soon as there are enough players: Let’s go! You will be able to start the game!
