Greetings fellow byte traveler!,

Congratulations! You have arrived at the right place at the right time! We are in the early days of cyber civilization. The legendary Queen MaXIne has just visited our beloved Zulias for the very first time.

Awestruck by the interior beauty of the rectangular slab of baked bits and bytes (for simplicity we will refer to them as „tiles“) used in our home city, she decided to make it the center of her queendom. A seemingly endless tiling phase has just begun! Help her establish her empire and lead our civilization into a golden age.

But … oh no! There are evil AI-Players that want to use the power of our beautiful tiles for the evil king Tolondras! How many of them can you take up? One, two, or even three? Show them who is the greatest tiler in town!
