Q2:

- finish the network and merge it with main

Q3:

- merging the main with my networkBranch makes my project disappear. Maybe thats because main gets built with maven now.

- planning next steps for me
    - Encoder/Decoder for end-to-end encryption of chat messages?
    - making the game playable via localhost wlan?

- all SpotBugs are done in model

Q2:

- fix SpotBugs in View in main
- getThisPlayersName() is not used in GameModel, but has to be in the Model Interface, otherwise it can't be accessed.
  Please find an elegant solution.
- create tasks for next week

Q1:

- refactored the code so there is less code duplicates
- made it possible to play in network mode by only starting one main class.
- made it possible to chose between network mode and hot seat mode
- the first client that tries to log into the server becomes the server
- implemented the Strategy Design Pattern for Model Strategies

Q2:

- refactor my code, find all bugs with spotbugs and checkstyle
- in network mode, directly show the number of players that already logged in (maybe also their names, the view has to
  decide that)
- add JavaDoc to my code
- meet with the team and Chris at 16 O'Clock

Q3:

Q1:

- meet with Chris
- tried all day to connect my laptop (Windows 11) with my other Laptop (Windows 8.1) with my cyberzul client server
  structure
- set the serverSocket to listen to the local IP address
- turned off the Firewall of my Laptops
- set my Wifi to private (private Networks are trusted, so they have more functionality and visibility than public
  networks)
- pinged my laptop with ping <IP adress> and he responded
- tried telnet (to see if a connection could be built. It couldn't)
- tried netcat (to see if a connection could be built. It couldn't)
- I know the local IP addresses of my laptops by heart now and will never forget them again....

Q2:

- continue trying. More googeling. Maybe I find some code that already works.
- ask StackOverflow
- try to connect with netcat to a very simple server
- try to connect with telnet to a very simple server
- fix (or suppress) all SpotBugs that are thrown that are in the network code
- fix all CheckStyles in the network code
- make it possible to connect via Wi-Fi

Q3:

- why doesn't my connection work?
