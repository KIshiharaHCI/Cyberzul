# Azul Game 

This is the Azul game from our project for LMU in the summer term 2022. 

## Dependencies

We use Java 17 and JUnit 5.8.1 for this project.
It was tested on Windows 11 with Java 17.0.3, so no other guarantees can be made.

## Start the Game

Everything is already compiled. Make sure you have installed Java version 17 on your computer. 
Execute the jar-file with command: 

`java -jar team12.jar`
