# Azul Game 

This is the Azul game from our project for LMU in the summer term 2022. With it the player can play the Azul Game on his personal computer. 
For features that are going to come in the future, we refer to our CHANGELOG. 

## Dependencies

We use Java 17 and JUnit 5.8.1 for this project.
It was tested on Windows 11 with Java 17.0.3, so no other guarantees can be made.

## How to start the game

Everything is already compiled. Make sure you have installed Java version 17 on your computer. 
Execute the jar-file with command: 

`java -jar team12.jar`
