9. AI opponents
10. Moving animations for the tiles.
11. The player can choose, in which order he tiles his wall. If for instance he is able to move the tiles from the third
    the fourth row and the fifth row, he can decide on his own, which tile he is moving first and which one he is moving
    next.
12. The own board is depicted larger than the boards of opponents, but by clicking on the boards of the opponents, they
    are enlarged while the own board is scaled down. This way it's easier to check out the boards of the opponents.
13. The board of the player whose turn it is, is encircled by a green border, so it's easier to keep track of who has to
    make his move.
